 <body>
   
     <p>Hello there, I am Hana. I am a first year Graphic Design student. I am very passionate in doing designs that can help and educate others. I started digital drawing in highschool for fun, until I joined the graphic design class and doing designs for my highschool clubs. I started gaining more interest so my teacher told me about graphic design at Algonquin College. I am glad I have entered a program that I enjoy doing and learning new content.</p>
    
     <p>Now almost finishing first year of Graphic Design. I see that I have improved in my work. Even though it was not easy the work paid off. Getting the experience and knowlegde made me open a small business. I create stickers that have to do with culture and my religion Islam. I am thankful for having the oppurtunity to show off my designs in a manner that helps represent who I am as a person. </p>


         <p>Favourite quote is <blockquote> <em>Trust God in everyting you do, He has your back every step you take.</em> - Hana Ahmed</blockquote> </p>
